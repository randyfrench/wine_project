### I. Project Overview
---
#### Abstract: Using chemical analysis to determine the origin of wines

#### 1. Description

Individual Projects

Codeup students will work on individual data science projects that touch the full DS pipeline.
This time is meant to address feedback that Codeup alumni's portfolios tend to look similar and re-enforce skills in time management and completing end to end data science projects.


#### 2. Deliverables

- Github Repo w/ Final Notebook and README
- Sections indicated with markdown headings in my final notebook with a good title and the documentation is sufficiently explanatory and of high quality
- Project summary and writeup


### II. Executive Summary
---

#### 1. Goals:

- With this project I am striving to create machine learning model/s to predict the origin of wines using chemical analysis. 
This dataset was acquired through UCI's Machine Learning Repository and be found at https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine

- Thoroughly document each step
- Make sure project is reproduceable

#### 2. Key findings:

- Clean dataset
- No data dictionary, had to search all the feature meanings.


#### 3. Recommendations:

- Better documentation of what the type/class of wine represent of which growers.
- Have the column names in the data set.
---

### III. Project

#### 1. Questions 

- Can the chemical makeup of wine be used to determine the cultivator/s?

### 2. Findings
#### My findings are:
- The logistic regression model performed the best.

### IV. Data Context
---

#### 1. Data Dictionary

Following acquisition and preparation of the initial data frame from the UCI Machine Learning webpage,  the data frame used in this project contain the following variables, which I had to look up myself. Contained values are defined along with their respective data types.

| Variable                     | Definition                                         | Data Type  |

| total_phenols                | important plant consituents with redox properties  | float64    |
| flavanoids                   | type of antioxidant                                | float64    |
| nonflavanoid_phenols         | phenolic compounds with variable structures        | float64    |
| proanthocyanins              | condensed tannins that srongly influence the       |            |
|                              | perceived astringency                              | float64    |
| color_intensity              | is an amount of color                              | float64    |

- I did not use any modules in this project

### VII. Project Reproduction
---

To recreate and reproduce results of this project, you will need to download the ataset through UCI's Machine Learning Repository  at https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine then copy the repo and run it.

### VIII. Project Summary
-----

This was a project that I was able to pick for myself. Wine classification. I used a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Using chemical analysis to determine the origin of wines. There is so much data out in the public domain to evaluate, that I had a hard time trying to choose what to pick. However, I do like wine, so thought it would be a good project to undertake. I only had a small amount of time to pick and move on and this was the one that I found. Of the four supervised machine learning models I tested, the Logistic Regression Model performed the best. Take a look and see what you think.

I look forward to learning more as I move forward with my time at Codeup.
